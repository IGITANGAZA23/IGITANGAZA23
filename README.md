# IGITANGAZA

Backend developer focused on **NestJS** and **Java**, building systems that move from idea to production—fast and clean.  
I design reliable APIs, scalable architectures, and practical solutions that solve real problems without noise.  
Working across a lean stack: **TypeScript, Node.js, Java, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, Docker, Git**.  
Exploring advanced, current, and emerging technologies—especially where **AI** meets real-world products.  
I build and ship AI-driven solutions with one mindset: **minimum process, maximum delivery**.  
Open to meaningful collaboration and ambitious ideas.
